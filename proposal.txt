Cluster Analysis of NBA Players

In building an NBA team, we want playesr that complement each other. For example, if a team already has a high scoring wing player, they should look in the market for a defensive-oriented post player. This project hopes to use clustering techniques to categorize both players today and historical NBA players into distinct groups. For example, players like George Gervin and Tracey McGrady will fall under the category of the "offensive wing player," and players like Eric Dampier or Dikembe Motumbo will be categorized as "defensive post player."
In addition, we hope to use regression to determine the best possible team composition given a pool of available playesr. At the end, we hope to create a tool to help coaches examine the free agency market, as well as to create a "historical best team". 

We will use NBA statistics from Basketball-Reference.com as our dataset:
http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/
We plan to web scrape and store the data in a SQL database. 

Clustering will be based on statistical similarity. We think there will seperate clusters based on player position as well as player output, and we hope to perform this using K-means clustering. 

Our regession will have values of "talent", "coaching", and "team chemistry". "Talent" will be defined as player season PER (player efficiency rating), "coaching" will be defined as coach's historical win percentage, and "team chemistry" still needs to be decided (something based on clustering).


NOTE: Depending on availability of certain datasets, we may also work on a text classification problem. We may classify a body of tweets, survey data of some sort, or customer-generated business data and attempt to draw some meaningful conclusions from it. If for some reason the data from Basketball-Reference.com is not sufficient or we acquire a good dataset from somewhere during this coming week, we may look to this direction.
